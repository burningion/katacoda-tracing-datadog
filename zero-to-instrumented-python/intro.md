# Zero to Instrumented in Python

What does a properly instrumented Python application look like? What benefits does instrumentation bring?

In this quick workshop, we'll run through the steps necessary to add Datadog's APM product to an existing Flask application, along with loggging, and trace / log correlation. 

We'll get a feel for a quick observability win, via automatic instrumentation.

You can run through this scenario with a free Datadog trial account by signing up [here](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
