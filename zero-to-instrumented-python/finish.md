# Adding Observability with Distributed Tracing

As we've seen, distributed tracing is just one of many tools to help increase your visibility into the complex systems you deploy and manage every day.

It's one facet of a many faceted approach, to being able to reliable diagnose production systems and problems _before_ your customers notice.

I hope this lesson gives you some ideas for how you can add custom traces to your company's systems, and start building observability systems that fit your particular business and legacy software problems.

It's an exciting time to be in software development. Let's continue to build systems we can all be proud of.
