# Modern Observability in Practice with Datadog

In this workshop, we'll apply observability principles to a partially broken eCommerce app who's team has started the move to microservices.

We'll first run the app, confirm that it's broken, and then instrument it with Datadog. 

Next, we'll send some example traffic to it, and try to discover the parts that are broken.

Finally, we'll discover the line numbers to fix, along with a few bottlenecks written into the source, push a fix, and confirm that it is indeed fixed.
