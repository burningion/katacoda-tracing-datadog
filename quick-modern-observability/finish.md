# Adding Observability with Distributed Tracing

As we've seen, distributed tracing is just one of many tools to help increase your visibility into the complex systems you deploy and manage every day.

It's one piece of a many faceted approach, to being able to reliable diagnose production systems and problems _before_ your customers notice.

I hope this lesson gives you some ideas for how you can add custom traces to your software systems, and start building observability systems that improve the lives of the people building and using our software systems.

It's an exciting time to be in software development. Let's build software systems we can be proud of.
