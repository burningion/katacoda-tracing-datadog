# Modern Observability in Practice with Datadog

In this workshop, we'll apply a few observability principles to a partially broken eCommerce app that has started the move to microservices.

We'll first run the app, then instrument it with Datadog. Next, we'll send some example traffic to it, and try to discover the parts that are broken.

Finally, we'll discover the line numbers to fix, along with a few bottlenecks written into the source.

You can run through this scenario with a trial Datadog account by signing up [here](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
