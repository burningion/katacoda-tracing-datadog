# Distributed Tracing with APM Workshop

Welcome to the workshop! We'll be running a docker-compose command, allowing us to spin up an entire environment.

This workshop assumes you've created a Datadog account, and are following along with Datadog open in another browser.

A Datadog trial account should be enough to complete all steps in the workshop.
